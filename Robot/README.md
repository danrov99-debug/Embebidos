# Autonomous Surveillance and Communication Robotic Vehicle

## Description
This project consists of an autonomous robotic vehicle equipped with a robotic arm, designed for area monitoring, patrol routines, and communication support in hazardous or restricted environments.

The robot is capable of performing programmed patrol rounds, collecting environmental data through sensors, and acting as a mobile communication relay between separated points where traditional infrastructure is unavailable.  
This project is intended for educational, research, and simulation purposes.
